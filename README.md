# CityRelocationCostDP
A Dynamic Programming Approach For City Relocation Cost Problem:

A Dynamic Programming Approach As A Solution For Kleinberg's Algorithm Book Exercise 6.4
Test cases should be in format of below:

operation_costs = [[1,4,1],
                   [20,1,20]]
// costs of operation in 0th city in first month is 1, in second is 4, in third is 1
relocation_costs = [[0,20],
                    [10,0]]
// cost of relocation from city i to j is relocation_costs[i][j]
